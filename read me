==================== -[Set Up Instructions]- ====================
Assuming all files are open in eclipse java, do the following to properly run the system:
1) In the Server class, select the "Run As" option and select the "Java application" option.
2) In the ErrorSimulator class, select the "Run As" option and select the "Java application" option.
3) In the Client class, select the "Run As" option and select the "Java application" option.
4) In the Console, follow the given user prompts to run the system.
	A) You will be asked to enter a file name or to type 'exit' to shutdown the Client.
		- (EX: {file name example}     test.txt    )
	B) Once a file name is entered, the Client will ask you if it is a read or write request.
		- (EX: {response example for read request}     r     )
	C) After the request type is entered, the system will run and end in the ErrorSimulator Console.
	D) To be able to send another request, change the Console display to the Client, and follow the prompts again.
